What is maven
-------------
Maven is a build automation tool used primarily for Java projects.

1.Maven life cycle
-------------------
Validate:- Runs checks to ensure that the project is correct and
that all dependencies are downloaded and available.

Compile:- Compiles the source code.
Test: Runs unit tests using frameworks. This step doesnâ€™t
require that the application be packaged.

Package:- Assembles compiled code into a distributable format,
such as JAR or WAR.

Install:- Installs the packaged archive into a local repository.
The archive is now available for use by any project running on
that machine.

Deploy:- Pushes the built archive into a remote repository for
use by other teams and team members.

Because the default life cycle clearly defines the ordering of the phases, you
can generate an artifact simply by running the command mvn package. Maven will
automatically execute all of the phases prior to the requested phase

2.What is maven repository
--------------------------
The maven local repository is a local folder 
that is used to store all your project's dependencies

3.What is maven pom
-------------------
A Project Object Model or POM is the fundamental unit of work in Maven.
 It is an XML file that contains information about the project and configuration details
